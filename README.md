# Template for ROS
This holds docker containers so we can work together very easily

In the file run you can find several functions that can be used to setup the environment

Be sure that docker engine is installed ( we don't need the docker desktop)

1. chmod +x ./run

2. sudo ./run install

3. To run the simulation: sudo ./run start

4. development docker -> so you can build: sudo ./run terminal

5. Before shutting down: sudo ./run stop
